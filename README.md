# 🎮 Loot Vault

> **A Gamified DeFi Ecosystem & Decentralized Job Board built on Stellar Soroban**  
> *Featuring a LitRPG / System Interface Aesthetic*

Loot Vault is a next-generation Web3 platform combining **no-loss yield protocols** and **trustless escrow** for freelancers, all wrapped in an immersive, dark-mode "System/RPG" interface. Built with **Soroban smart contracts** (Rust), **Next.js**, and **Stellar blockchain**.

## 🚀 Vision

Loot Vault reimagines DeFi participation through an RPG lens. Participants are adventurers. Yield pools are treasure vaults. Freelancers are mercenaries taking bounties. The system watches over it all with real-time event streaming, cryptographic security, and trustless automation.

### Two Core Protocols

#### 🎰 **Loot Vault Protocol** (No-Loss Yield)
Users deposit test XLM into a shared vault. The protocol generates yield. A winner is randomly drawn to receive the accumulated yield, while all participants retain their principal. It's a fair, transparent lottery—no house always wins.

- ✅ Deployed to Stellar Testnet
- ✅ E2E tests passing with mocked StellarAssetContracts
- ✅ TypeScript bindings ready for frontend integration

#### ⚔️ **Mercenary Board Protocol** (Milestone-Based Escrow)
A trustless job board for freelancers. Clients post jobs and lock bounties. Freelancers submit work. Clients release funds milestone-by-milestone. A timelock dispute mechanism ensures neither party can lose funds unfairly.

- ✅ Deployed to Stellar Testnet
- ✅ Strict `require_auth()` security implemented
- ✅ E2E tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript bindings generated

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75+: [Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Stellar CLI** (soroban-cli): `cargo install soroban-cli`
- **Node.js** 18+: [Install](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Freighter Wallet** browser extension: [Get it here](https://www.freighter.app/)

### 1. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loot-vault.git
cd loot-vault
```

### 2. Build Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
cargo build --release
```

Run the full E2E test suite:

```bash
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1
```

Deploy to Stellar Testnet:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --network testnet \
  --source $YOUR_ACCOUNT \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/mercenary_board.wasm
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the LitRPG interface.

### 4. Backend Indexer (Optional)

```bash
cd backend
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

The backend listens for Soroban contract events and feeds real-time data to the frontend.

## 🎨 UI/UX: LitRPG System Aesthetic

The Loot Vault frontend embraces a **dark, futuristic "System Interface"** inspired by sci-fi RPGs:

- **Dark mode by default** (true black backgrounds, neon accents)
- **Retro-futuristic typography** (monospace, glitch effects)
- **Animated status panels** (health bars, mana pools, quest logs)
- **Glowing borders & holographic card effects**
- **Framer Motion micro-interactions** (smooth state transitions)
- **Accessibility-first**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, high contrast

Future contributor batches will focus on building a reusable component library that makes these LitRPG patterns easy to extend.
